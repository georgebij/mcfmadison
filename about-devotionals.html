    <h1>About These Devotionals</h1>

    <p>
      The daily devotionals shared on this website are offered to encourage
      quiet reflection, prayer, and trust in God’s Word. They are intended to
      support believers in their daily walk with Christ through thoughtful
      meditation on Scripture.
    </p>

    <h2>Source and Inspiration</h2>

    <p>
      These devotionals are prayerfully adapted and rephrased from classic
      Christian devotional literature, particularly the writings of
      <strong>:Charles Haddon Spurgeon</strong>,
      especially his well-known work <em>Morning and Evening</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the original themes and titles are often retained, the content has
      been thoughtfully reworded and contextualized for contemporary readers.
      The aim is not to reproduce the original text, but to faithfully convey
      its spiritual emphasis in fresh language.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      These devotionals are shared freely for spiritual nourishment and
      encouragement. They are not presented for commercial purposes, but as a
      ministry resource for personal reflection and growth in faith.
    </p>

    <div class="about-note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> The original writings of Charles H. Spurgeon are in
      the public domain. Any adaptations presented here are offered with
      gratitude and respect for the enduring legacy of his ministry.
