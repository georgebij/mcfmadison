    "title": "The First Promise and Our Present Hope",
    "scripture": "Genesis 3: 15",
    "summary": "God’s first promise in Scripture assures us that evil will not have the final word, even when the world feels broken and uncertain.",
    "content": "The first promise in the Bible was spoken in a moment of deep failure and loss. Humanity had fallen, trust was broken, and the future seemed uncertain. Yet God spoke hope into that darkness by promising that evil would one day be defeated.\n\nToday, we live in a world filled with anxiety—wars, injustice, moral confusion, and personal struggles press in on us daily. At times, it feels as though evil has the upper hand, and we experience its effects in our weakness, fear, and wounded hearts. Like a bruised heel, the pain is real and often close to home.\n\nBut the promise of God reminds us that suffering is not the end of the story. Christ has already dealt a decisive blow to sin and death through the cross and resurrection. Though we may still feel the struggle, the outcome is not in doubt. Evil will be fully overcome, and God’s purposes will stand.\n\nAs we walk through this year, we do so with confidence—not because life will be easy, but because God’s promise is sure. What feels like defeat today will one day be revealed as part of God’s victory in Christ.",
    "prayer": "Lord, when the world feels broken and my strength feels small, remind me of Your promise. Help me to trust Your victory in Christ and to walk forward in faith and hope. Amen."
